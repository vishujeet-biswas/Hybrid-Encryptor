# Hybrid Encryptor

Hybrid Encryptor is a web application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using various encryption algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting messages, selecting encryption algorithms, choosing operations, and viewing the encrypted or decrypted output.

## Getting Started

To run the Hybrid Encryptor application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hybrid-encryptor.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

4. Access the application in your web browser at "http://localhost:8501".

## Usage:
   - Enter the plaintext message in the "Input" field.
   - Select an encryption algorithm from the drop-down list.
   - Choose the operation (encrypt or decrypt) from the radio buttons.
   - Enter the encryption key in the "Key" field.
   - If the selected algorithm is "Hybrid," enter a second key in the "Second Key" field.
   - Click the "Submit" button.
   - The encrypted or decrypted output will be displayed below the input fields.


## Available Algorithms:

- Mono-alphabetic Cipher
- Vigenere Cipher
- Vernam Cipher
- One-Time Pad
